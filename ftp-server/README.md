# FTP Server

This directory contains the implementation of an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server written in C.
The project demonstrates medium-level concepts of the C programming language and explores networking, multithreading, and file handling through a practical implementation.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **FTP Server Implementation:** A minimal and functional server adhering to FTP principles.
- **Client Implementation:** Includes a CLI-based FTP client for testing and interaction.
- **Logging Mechanism:** Provides logging functionality to track server activity.
- **Utility Functions:** Contains helper functions to assist with common operations.
- **Modular Codebase:** Code is organized into multiple files for better readability and maintainability.
- **Test Suite:** Includes test scripts and files in the `test` directory.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run the FTP server, you will need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts
- An FTP client (optional, for testing)

### Build Instructions

1. Navigate to the `ftp-server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ftp-server
   ```
2. Build the project using the provided Makefile:
   ```
   make
   ```
   - This will generate the server and client binaries.

### Running the Server
To start the server, run the following command:
 ```
./cli_ftp_client
```

## Development

### Key Files
- ftp-server.c: The main implementation of the FTP server.
- cli_ftp_client.c: A command-line client for testing the server.
- log.c: Provides a simple logging mechanism to track server events.
- utils.c: Includes reusable helper functions.
- ftp.h: Header file containing shared declarations.
